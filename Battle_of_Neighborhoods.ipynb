    "The health industry and its related businesses have been growing steadily during the past few decades in North America. Given the soaring awareness of personal healthcare and pursuits of healthy lifestyles, new business interests emerge in those big metropolitan areas which cover a wide range of products and services. In this project, we investigate and compare the potential investment opportunities for healthy food business in two major financial centers: New York city and the city of Toronto. Since the recent legalization of recreational marijuana in Canada and an increasing number of states in the U.S., cannabis and other natural herb based heath products are given more attention as diet supplement and health improvement alternatives. So here we want to forecast and compare the business potential of cannabis related heath products in those cities by studying the heath lifestyle preference  statistics and based on that, further identify the most promising locations of our new business."
